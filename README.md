Demo implementation of the [SCA setup element](https://www.airwallex.com/docs/js/sca/sca-setup/)

We offer both `scaSetup` and `scaVerify` as separate components.
We usually recommend launching the `scaSetup` flow right after a user finishes onboarding. This helps them set up strong authentication early and makes the whole experience more secure and smooth.

How to run the app:
- `cd server` and `node server.js`
- `cd client` and npm start
